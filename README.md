I saved my git credentials permanently so I never have to enter my username or password when performing actions on my machine

EXAMPLES
The point of this helper is to reduce the number of times you must type your username or password. For example:

$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>

[several days later]
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
[your credentials are used automatically]
